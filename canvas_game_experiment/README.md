-for NPC detection:  

  -is there a way I can adjust the alpha value of the sprite pictures so that the pictures are still transparent (at least appears to be to most people), but have a specific alpha value? this way the alpha value can act sort of like a 'flag'. if a particular value is 'seen' by the user during collision detection, a different response can be evoked. I can't think of any other ways right now to handle different NPC behavior :|.
