an ASCII art generator! just select a picture locally, click 'get ascii art', and then click 'highlight' for a better view. Also, you probably want to zoom out all the way. ^^    
    
this generator works by taking pixel data from the selected picture, grayscaling all the pixels, and then determining what symbol to use to represent that shade of grey. Definitely easier than trying to figure out symbol ranges for every possible color.
