<h2>chineseQuiz</h2>
* small app intended to test the user's knowledge of a random Chinese character's definition and pinyin. 
    
My next step is to try to collect as many characters as I can and format each in a table, i.e. {value: "ç†Š", pinyin: xiong2, ...}    
I think I can achieve this with web-scraping!
